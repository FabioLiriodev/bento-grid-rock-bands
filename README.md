<h2> 📝 Project Description 📝 </h2>

**Bento Grids of Rock Bands** is a web development project focused on creating visually appealing and organized grid-based layouts (bento grids) using HTML and CSS. The project represents key information about three iconic rock 'n roll bands: Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Pink Floyd. It was designed for high-resolution screens (1440px and above) and brings a modern approach to content presentation.

<h2> ⚙️ Features ⚙️ </h2>

✅ Hover effects on text and grid cards

✅ Box-shadow effects on grid cards and images

✅ High-resolution web development (1440px and higher)

<h2> 🖱️ How to Use the Application? 🖱️ </h2>

When accessing the main page of the application, users will see three unique bento grids, each dedicated to one of the featured rock bands. 

By hovering over grid items, subtle visual effects (like text color change and shadow highlights) enhance user interaction and engagement. The layout is optimized for large screens, providing a smooth and organized viewing experience.

<h2> 🧗 Challenges Faced During Development 🧗 </h2>

1️⃣ Structuring a custom display:grid layout from the author’s original concept

2️⃣ Acquiring and adapting conceptual art images generated by AI

3️⃣ Organizing each grid-item to accommodate content efficiently and aesthetically

<h2> 📝 Additional Information 📝 </h2>

The radio and ticket images were adapted from the Bento Grid by Ivan Voldi concept art.

Other images were generated by AI, and band-related data (like total streaming numbers) was researched on Spotify.

<h2> 🔮 Future Perspectives 🔮 </h2>

🚀 Implement responsiveness for mobile and tablet resolutions;

🚀 Add new bento grids featuring other rock 'n roll bands;

🚀 Progressively refactor code to improve efficiency and readability;

🚀 Fetch dynamic music data (like song titles and streaming numbers) via the Spotify API;
